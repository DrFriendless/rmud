# RMud

This is an exercise to learn Ruby on Rails. I intend it to be some sort of rudimentary extensible MUD loosely based on my  great love, LPMud. At the moment it looks like it will be better to use Mongo as the database so it won't technically be Rails. Apparently the Mongo interface uses ActiveRecord anyway.
